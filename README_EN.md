## 📦 Game Packaging

The game provides multiple packaging tools to convert the Python game into standalone executable files that can run without installing Python.

### 🚀 Quick Packaging (Recommended)

#### For Windows Users - Use Batch Scripts
```bash
# Complete packaging (with audio fixes)
build_sound_fixed.bat

# Quick packaging (for testing)
quick_build.bat
```

#### For All Platforms - Use Python Script
```bash
python build_game.py
```

### 📁 Packaging Tools Description

| Packaging Tool | Platform | Features | Recommended Use |
|----------------|----------|----------|----------------|
| `build_sound_fixed.bat` | Windows | Complete audio fixes, detailed Chinese prompts | **Final Release** |
| `build_game.py` | Cross-platform | Python implementation, detailed error handling | **Main Tool** |
| `quick_build.bat` | Windows | Fast and simple, suitable for testing | **Development Testing** |
| `create_portable.bat` | Windows | Creates portable version with launcher | **User Distribution** |

### 🎯 Create Portable Version

After packaging is complete, you can create a complete portable version:
```bash
# Create portable version (includes all resource files)
create_portable.bat
```

Portable version features:
- 📁 Complete game folder
- 🎮 Friendly launcher script
- 📋 Detailed game instructions
- 📤 Can be directly shared with friends

### ✅ Packaging Requirements

**Required Files:**
- `alien_invasion.py` - Main program
- `images/` - Image resource folder
- `sounds/` - Audio resource folder
- `leaderboard.json` - Leaderboard data file

**Environment Requirements:**
- Python 3.8+
- PyInstaller (`pip install pyinstaller`)

### 🔍 Packaging Verification

After packaging is complete, please test the following functions:
- ✅ Game starts normally
- ✅ Images display correctly
- ✅ Sound effects play normally
- ✅ Background music can be controlled
- ✅ Leaderboard data saves
- ✅ Control keys work properly

### 📊 Packaging File Description

**Packaging Results:**
```
dist/
└── AlienInvasion.exe    # Main program (about 10-20MB)
```

**Portable Version Structure:**
```
AlienInvasion_Portable/
├── AlienInvasion.exe     # Main program
├── Start Game.bat       # Launcher script
├── Game Instructions.txt # Game instructions
├── images/              # Image resources
└── sounds/              # Audio resources
```

### 🐛 Packaging Troubleshooting

1. **Audio Missing**: Use `build_sound_fixed.bat` instead of manual packaging
2. **Image Display Issues**: Ensure `images/` folder exists and is complete
3. **Startup Failure**: Check if `leaderboard.json` file is included
4. **Font Display Issues**: Confirm system has Chinese font support
